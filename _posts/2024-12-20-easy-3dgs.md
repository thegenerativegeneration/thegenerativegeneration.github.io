I am currently preparing a course on applied novel 3D graphics for media professionals and artists who want to learn how to use 3D reconstructions, AI-created assets and augmented reality in their work.

## 3D Gaussian Splatting and AR

To this end, I am on the lookout for the easiest possible way to create experiences from 3D reconstructions made with Gaussian Splatting. 

One of the possible options is **Spline** which works without any code. Spline sadly does not have any augmented reality capabilities.

I have created a sample experience below.

<details>
<summary>View Spline Experience</summary>
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@splinetool/viewer@1.9.52/build/spline-viewer.js"></script>
<spline-viewer url="https://prod.spline.design/15bXeAhQL-MA-eLO/scene.splinecode"></spline-viewer>
</details>

Another up-and-coming options is **Niantic Studio** with **8th Wall**. It supports AR and VR. As far as I have seen some coding may be required which makes it a suboptimal option for the course.

</details>

Both 8th Wall and Spline have a free tier, support Gaussian Splatting and allow sharing of created experiences without self-hosting.

Meta's **Spark AR** which I originally had in mind was sadly shut down at the start of 2025. It was a great tool for creating AR experiences within Meta's products, although it did not yet support Gaussian Splatting.
